#esa-indexer

Creates an inverted index based on arbitrary Wikipedia snapshots to be used for [ESA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explicit_semantic_analysis] (Explicit Semantic Analysis).
The indexing is implemented using [DKPro](http://www.ukp.tu-darmstadt.de/?id=2643) which is based on UIMA. Initially a local database representation of Wikipedia has to be created using [JWPL](https://code.google.com/p/jwpl/).
